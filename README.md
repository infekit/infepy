## Description

Infepy is a tool that applies morphing to mesh geometries. It performs
morphing operations and achieves desired shape transformations between
the source and target geometries using the specified landmarks. It
allows to morph a source mesh to a target geometry by utilizing Radial
Basis Function.

The source mesh should be a LS-DYNA .key file format, while the
landmarks file can be either in .csv or .key. The target geometry can be
a single item or multiple items, and you can find more detailed
information about this process
[here](https://infekit.github.io/infepy/morphing.html).
