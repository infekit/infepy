## Description

Infepy is a tool that applies morphing to mesh geometries. It allows to
morph a source mesh to a target geometry by utilizing Radial Basis
Function. The source mesh should be a LS-DYNA .key file format, while
the landmarks file can be either in .csv or .key.

The target geometry can be a single item or multiple items, and you can
find more detailed information about this process
[here](https://infekit.github.io/infepy/3_morphing.html) . Infepy
provides the capability to perform morphing operations and achieve
desired shape transformations between the source and target geometries
using the specified landmarks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The input files for the morphing process include:

**Inputs:**

- Landmarked FE geometry. This geometry provides the landmarks from the
  source mesh.

- Finite Element Mesh

- Landmarked Segmented Geometry. This geometry provides the target shape
  that the FE geometry will be morphed to.

**Output:**

- Morphed geometry. Deformed mesh according to the landmarks provided.

## Morphing

from the command line *cd* into the directory ..Github/infepy/infepy :
`python morph.py --function $FUNCTION --smoothing $SMOOTHING`
